A Meticulously designed workhorse theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

Origami features extensive changes to the base UI, to create a clean and unobtrusive interface that you can work for hours in. Inspiration was taken from centuries of human typography and the timelessness of ink and folded paper ‚úíÔ∏è

**Other, about**
Origami was written for my own use case (_& as a personal challenge for Obsidian October 2022_), which is small quick bullet notes. I wanted something that mimicked the tactility of paper, but introduced digital tools. I also wanted it to be  Notably, I did not just want to simply style obsidian as something like a journal; I wanted to explore how the advantages and history of those two mediums interplay (gods, that was pretentious).

We have centuries of design principle in print. With that in mind I spent hours of research studying how factors such as contrast, age, typeface, and type settings affect legibility. Was there something scientifically proven to be the design silver bullet?

The answer is: of course not.

My research did leave me with some takeaways, though. I knew I wanted a good serifed typeface for legibility, and something fun and chunky for titles. I also wanted a strong, high contrast light mode, and to minimize ‚Äòrivers‚Äô.

For Obsidian October, I challenged myself to build a theme for how I used Obsidian. I wanted to finally learn how to (somewhat) write CSS. I never believed I would have ended up winning O_O, and I am beyond grateful for the consideration! It was an amazing experience learning, and I cannot wait to keep working on the theme :)
